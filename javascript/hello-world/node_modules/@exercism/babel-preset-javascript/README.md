# @exercism/babel-preset-javascript

This is the shared [`babel`][web-babel] preset configuration used by the [JavaScript track][git-javascript]. [Shareable configs][web-shareable-configs] are designed to work with the `presets` and `plugins` feature of `.babelrc` configuration files. This means you can use the same configuration you're used to on [Exercism][web-exercism] in your on projects!

> âš  It's customary to define dependencies such as `@babel/core` as _`peerDependency`_, so it's easy to determine its version by the including project, but because this preset is designed for end-usage, and we want to consolidate updating its dependencies in one place, we currently include these as hard dependencies.
>
> You can still override the version included via the `package-lock` file, tools like shrinkwrap, or dependency resolution such as `yarn` provides.

## Usage

To use the configuration, open your [babel configuration][web-babel-configuration] file, and add the following value to `presets`. For example, for JSON based configuration files:

```json
{
  "presets": ["@exercism/babel-preset-javascript"]
}
```

## Configuration

Find the configuration [here](index.js). It's goal is to enable babel's preset environment, and occasionally introduce experimental syntax before it becomes widely adopted (stage 3 and beyond, for those following TC39).
